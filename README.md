# Melody-extraction-results
Plots shows the melody extracted from the proposed method and the Melodia for the music excrepts having strong percussive components. In the figures, "Red" contours represents the Melody Extracted from the proposed spectro-temporal based  method and "Blue" contours represents the melody extracted from the salience based melody extraction system "Melodia" (http://mtg.upf.edu/technologies/melodia?p=Download%20and%20installation). From the plots we can observe that the melody extracted from the proposed method is comparable with that of the Melodia. In fact proposed method tracks the melody even in the regions of comparable strengths of vocals and the instrument. Proposed method mostly tracks higher octave in the strong percussive strokes with fast temp, even "Melodia" is also not free from tracking higher octaves but not as frequently as ours, which can be observed in Figure melody6.png.
